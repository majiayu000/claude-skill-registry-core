"""Tests for build_search_index.py scoring of root-mounted SKILL.md entries.

Background: many community catalog entries (sources/community.json) describe
skills whose SKILL.md lives at the repo root, encoded as path="". Treating an
empty path as "no install location" under-scored these skills on install
status, quality, and trust, dropping them below the visibility threshold even
though their install URL (repo) was fully resolvable.

These tests pin the behavior that path="" and path="." are equivalent to a
real subdirectory path for scoring purposes whenever a repo is present.
